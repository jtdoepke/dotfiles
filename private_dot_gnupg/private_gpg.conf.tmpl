# Export the smallest key possible. This removes all

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey,
# ensure that the cross certification "back signature" on the
# subkey is present and valid. This protects against a subtle attack
# against subkeys that can sign.

# keyserver
#-----------------------------

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.
# Use hkps because:
#   a) it more secure than hkp
#   b) it actually works inside Mintel's network
#keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
