# --------------------
# Append a `!` to the type, or use the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to indicate a
# breaking change (correlates with MAJOR in semantic versioning).
#
# Remember to:
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
#   * Use the git-interpret-trailers format for the footer i.e. `key: value` or `key = value`.
